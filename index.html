        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app
          platform’s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as
          to
          describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:<span> bundles of reusable, nestable
            code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components work
          in React Native.</p>

          React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
          JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you
          started or can serve as a refresher course.
        </p>
        <p>We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>+ components. </strong>The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
          approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
          JavaScript
          like so:<span class="grey-color">&lt;Text&gt; Hello, I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX </u> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
          JavaScript, you
          can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, <span class="grey-color">name</span>,
          and embedding it with curly braces
          inside <span class="grey-color">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for “properties”.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
          render,
          state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or
          that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
        </p>

        <svg width="100" height="8" viewBox="0 0 100 8" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
          <rect width="100" height="8" fill="black" />
        </svg>

        <hgroup>
          <h2>handling text input</h2>
          <sup>Chapter 4</sup>
        </hgroup>
        <p>
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an on<span>ChangeText</span> prop
          that
          takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function
          to
          be called when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In
          this
          new language, every single word is written the same way: 🍕. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
          translated
          as "🍕 🍕".
